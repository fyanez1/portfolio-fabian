**Design Reflection** <br>

 <p>One of the main changes I made to my concepts was changing the upvoting concept to a 5-star rating system. The reason for this is to allow buyers to have a better sense of how trustworthy a seller is and to better expose when sellers have sold low quality products in the past or items that did not turn out to be as advertised. With upvotes, there is not a way to express negative opinions. Having downvotes as well solves this issue but having a rating out of 5 is more expressive than downvotes since there is a wider range. Other than this concept, all the other concepts were implemented exactly as initially designed in A3. </p>
 <br>
 <p><b>Note:</b> The change for what was formerly the upvoting concept has not been implemented yet.</p>
