**Hunch:** <br>
Social media apps are designed to be as addictive as possible. Would it be possible to design a social media app that is designed to be less addictive? This seems counterintuitive since it implies trying to get users to use the app less.
<br>

**Interview 1 - high school friend**

<p>
The interviewee primarily uses YouTube and Instagram. He uses YouTube daily for podcasts and other content but finds its algorithm inconsistent. He described the algorithm as showing him a very small subset of his preferences at a time and these subsets would frequently and randomly change. In fact, he mentioned that it would occasionally recommend videos that he liked a year ago. He uses Instagram less frequently, mainly for messaging, reels, and seeing art-related posts. The reason he chooses to use Instagram over Tiktok for the short video format is because instagram has more non-video posts related to his interest in art. Many of the creators he likes are also only on Instagram. His justification for using Instagram’s messaging feature over other messaging apps is only when he wants to send people posts. He also mentioned his dissatisfaction toward Instagram’s search function and difficulty in accessing saved posts. Both platforms were noted as addictive, with Instagram's shorter videos making it more so. The user also mentioned extensions like "Dumbify" to make YouTube less addictive by removing recommendations and visual stimuli.

**Design Opportunities**

<ul>
    <li>
        App simplicity through is important according to both interviewees, meaning feature reduction and feature flexibility are key
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                According to both interviewees, simplicity of the user interface is key. Having many unused features and ads is very detrimental to the user experience. One possible solution for this is to have toggleable features, rather than removing them entirely for all users. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Offering built-in features to limit addictive behaviors rather than relying on extensions or other tools
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                While there are already extensions and tools that exist to make social media apps less addictive, the user experience would be much better if these features were already built-in. This could be done by having settings that users can modify to include or exclude certain moderation features. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        User profile personalization is key 
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The reason for this is because it makes the interactions between users feel more personal. This can be done by including typical optional profile parameters such as a profile picture and bio. In addition to this, these attributes should be displayed often and be noticeable to create a personable feel, rather than keeping these personalized attributes hidden. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Improving search functionality, refining content algorithms to be more holistic, and changing caption and comment overlay to be less obstructive
    </li>
</ul>

**raw interview notes**

<ul>
    <li>
        Interview 1
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Uses IG, youtube, reddit, linkedin <br>
                Uses youtube the most - daily<br>
                Doesn’t use instagram every day - reels, and messaging only to reply, normally uses other messaging apps, messages specific people on IG, doesn’t use all the features on IG, only looks at posts and stories occasionally<br>
                Search function is terrible, even if the name is exactly the same it doesn’t come up with the profiles<br>
                A lot harder to search posts with keywords on IG<br>
                Tiktok a lot better but instagram has everything on the same app<br>
                Uses instagram more than tiktok because some art posts are only on IG, tiktok is only video format mainly<br>
                Uses youtube for podcasts and stuff<br>
                Youtube features to change - algorithm is weird because it recommends very small subset of what you like at a time, then randomly starts showing you stuff that you liked a year ago, random subsets at a time, but the search function is better<br>
                Have to press about 5 buttons to see saved posts on instagram<br>
                The reels and tiktok captions sometimes block part of the screen overlay<br>
                Doesn’t like when you click into a post that’s a reel and when you scroll it keeps showing you reels
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Interview 2
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Uses IG to send funny memes <br>
                Compared to other social media apps, IG is more ironic, the humor is stuff you don’t find on other apps<br>
                Don’t like that it’s connected to Meta<br>
                Doesn’t use the stories feature<br>
                Would prefer to have app that is less generalized<br>
                Features that he doesn’t use are there so it’s more annoying since it’s just clutter<br>
                could have feature to remove features<br>
                Uses it multiple times a day<br>
                problem is that he uses it too much when he opens the app but agrees the effects of using the app could also be positive in moderation<br>
                Uses it to connect with friends because it feels less personal and people are already on it<br>
                Uses notifications for messages<br>
                Wouldn’t know what it would feel like to have a feature to remove features until he sees it<br>
                Do better at making it less visually appealing like monochrome feature<br>
                Also uses Discord, twitter, reddit, Line<br>
                Uses reels and posts for IG, connected to self as person while the other social media apps feel more anonymous, others are his online persona while IG is his public image<br>
                Overlap between people he messages on IG and discord, uses IG if he knows them in person<br>
                because IG ties to him as a person, it is him, while discord is just his name, slight nuance that makes it more personal
