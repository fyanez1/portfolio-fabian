**Heuristic Evaluation** <br>

Note: Wireframes are found below for reference.

 <ul>
    <li><b>Usability Criteria: </b> Discoverability and Pleasantness
        <ul>
            <li>the purpose is immediately clear. The presence of images with names and a price associated with them clearly indicates that the items are for sale.</li>
            <li>On the page for a specific item, the text needs to be more noticeable and prominent through size, color, font, surrounding whitespace, etc. so that the users clearly know what to do to buy an item.</li>
            <li>The main page of the interface is very calming because of its simplicity. The only features I chose to include on the main page are pagination and a search bar to keep the main page as simple as possible to effectively communicate the purpose of the app without a need for instructions.</li>
            <li>The color scheme I have on the wireframes is not coherent. I should pick colors that complement each other better and that also convey relative importance to parts of the layout. </li>
            <li>The item page may initially be overwhelming. To solve this, I can make the comment section collapsable.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Physical heuristics: </b>Situational Context and Fitt's Law
        <ul>
            <li>It is very easy to point to specific items on the main page since their click box is very large. </li>
            <li>The amount of space that each item takes makes it easy to reach a specific item that a user wants to click on.</li>
            <li>On the item page, it is very easy for users to navigate to the "join queue" button because of its size and color contrast. </li>
            <li>When on the page of an item, the situational context is not particularly clear. Therefore, I can add a navigation bar to keep the user's  mental picture of the app very clear. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Linguistic Level: </b>User language and consistency
        <ul>
            <li>On the item page, I use the term "join queue" for a user who is interested in buying an item. However, this is probably closer to developer language so I could rephrase it as "claim item"</li>
            <li>Familiarity with websites such as Amazon and Ebay makes the purpose very clear for the app since the layout follows the same convention at a fundamental level.</li>
            <li>Once an item is clicked, the next steps to take are no longer obvious since the process is different from buying something off of an E-commerce website such as Amazon or Ebay. Therefore, it will be very important to include text with specific instructions on how the process for buying an item works.</li>
            <li>There is a lack of informative messages so I should include them since the functionality may not be obvious to the user. </li>
            <li>The icons for profiles and the comment section layout follows convention for most social media apps. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
